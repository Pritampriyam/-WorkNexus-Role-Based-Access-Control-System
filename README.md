## 🔧 Configuration Files

- `package.json` - Lists dependencies, devDependencies, and project scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite application configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS theme and plugin settings
- `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript compiler options for app and tooling
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint rules and plugin settings
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS plugins for Tailwind

## ✅ Git and Repository Notes

- `node_modules/` is excluded in `.gitignore`
- Avoid committing generated files from `dist/`
- If you are on Windows and see line ending warnings, Git is only informing you about `LF` ↔ `CRLF` normalization
- Use `npm install` from the repo root, not `npm install` inside subfolders

## 🧪 Testing

Run the unit test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode while editing code:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## 🚀 Deploying

This is a static frontend application and can be deployed to any static hosting provider, including:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

## 💡 Troubleshooting

If `npm run dev` reports that `vite` is not recognized, make sure dependencies are installed and run:

```bash
npm install
npm exec -- vite --version
```

If the dev server still fails, try removing local dependencies and reinstalling:

```bash
rm -r node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
